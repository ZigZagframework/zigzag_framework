# Transformed Programs for Manually Checking Vulnerability Preservation

We randomly select 50 mixed programs in the SARD and generate transformed programs using 8 code transformations. We obtain 384 transformed programs because some vulnerable programs fail to generate transformed programs for some code transformations. We manually check if the transformed programs are still vulnerable.
